    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>
      Hello! My name is Jessica Marks, and I am a candidate for the Kellogg School of Management's One-Year MBA progra for theClass of 2015. At Kellogg, I enrolled as One Year student. 
      <section>
      The One-Year Program is designed to build upon business fundamentals learned in undergrad and get you back in the workforce with new skills and knowledge that will propel your career forward. I joined the program in June of 2014, and I will be graduating in June of 2015. The program is very fast-paced, but it has all of the benefits of a two-year program, consolidated into one year.

  <h3>Completed Courses</h3>
